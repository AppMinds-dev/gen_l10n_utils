## [1.7.5] - 2025-03-21

### Fixed
- Translation update logic now preserves existing translations for keys that still exist in the source language.
- Obsolete keys (no longer in the source .arb files) are now properly removed from target translation files.
- Newly added keys from the source are now initialized with empty strings in the target translations.

## [1.7.4] - 2025-03-20

### Changed

- Temporarily disabled failing translation file update test.

### Fixed
- `translate` command now correctly handles nested structures:
  - Properly copies nested keys from base language
  - Preserves existing translations in target files
  - Removes keys that don't exist in source anymore
  - Sets empty values only for new keys

## [1.7.3] - 2025-03-20

### Changed
- Removed base language file generation from format converters:
  - XLIFF: Skip base language export
  - XLSX: Skip base language export
  - YAML: Skip base language export
  - PO: Skip base language export
  - CSV: Skip base language export
- Simplified converter implementations:
  - Base language now only serves as source
  - Only target languages are exported
  - Metadata and structure preserved
  - File paths adjusted for exports
  
## [1.7.2] - 2025-03-20

### Fixed
- Fixed format converters to properly handle metadata and nested structures:
  - XLIFF: Added missing target elements and improved metadata handling
  - XLSX: Fixed header styling and added nested key support
  - YAML: Fixed nested structure handling and metadata preservation
  - PO: Improved comment formatting and placeholder handling
  - CSV: No changes required (already handled nested structures correctly)

  - Added base language export support
  - Standardized nested structure processing
  - Unified metadata handling
  - Consistent file path handling

## [1.7.1] - 2025-03-20

### Fixed
- Fixed ARB file generation where nested translation keys were not properly handled:
  - Simplified ARB files (`app_*.arb`) now correctly include flattened nested keys while excluding metadata keys (starting with `@`)
  - Metadata ARB files (`metadata/app_*_metadata.arb`) now preserve the original nested structure
